This Python program asks the user to enter three numbers. It then uses the "find_max" function to determine which of these numbers is the largest. The function compares numbers using "if-elif-else" statements. Once the program has found the largest number, it displays it to the user. It introduces basic concepts such as user input, functions, conditional logic and output in Python.
